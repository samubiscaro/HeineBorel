# Hausdorff spaces

1. [Rahel Hugener]

- Let q : X -> Y be an open quotient map. Then Y is Hausdorff iff {(x,y) : q(x) = q(y)} is a closed subset of X \times X. (Lee Prop. 3.57)
  - Cor : X is Hausdorff iff diagonal map closed.

# Quotient Maps

2. [Carl, Justin]

Formalize quotient maps and some of their properties. Material in "Recognizing Quotient Maps between Known Spaces" (Lee p. 69).

# Convergence

3. [Alexander Rudenya, Aron Erben, David Sanchez]

Define closure (Cl).

- Prove characterization:
  A closed iff
  A = Cl A
  Every point of X \ A has a neighborhood contained in X \ A.
- Prove that a point x is in Cl A iff there is a proper filter containing A with F -> x. (Bradley Thm. 3.9.)

# Connected spaces

4. [Aroon, Äia + Leon, Luka + Elia]

- Prove that the connected subsets of R are intervals.
- Corollary: Intermediate value theorem.

5. [Lea + Christina + Jana]

Prove more properties of connected spaces (Lee Prop 4.9)

# Compactness

6. [Julia + Nicole, Mona, Eray + Emilie]

- Prove Heine-Borel: Subsets of R^n are compact iff they are closed and bounded.
- Corollary: Extreme value theorem.

7. [Livia, Patrik]

- If X is Hausdorff and A,B \sub X are disjoint and compact, then there are disjoint open subsets U,V \sub X with A \sub U and B \sub V. (Lee Lemma 4.34).
- Corollary: Compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are closed. - Corollary: Closed map lemma.

8.  Define `proper maps` and prove some of their properties. (Lee pp. 118)

# Independently proposed projects

9. [Jarod Daschkewitz + Simon Baumgartner + Elina Kästle.]

Formalize and prove relationships between:

- sequential compactness
- open-cover compactness
- limit-point compactness

10. [Samuele Biscaro]

A metric space X is compact iff it is totally bounded and complete.
