# Heine Borel theorem in Lean

**Welcome to Topology in Lean!**

In this project, we will formalize the Heine Borel theorem for metric spaces. We will allow ourselves to use everything in [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) apart from `Mathlib.Topology`. We start from the repository of the course [MAT740 TopologyInLean HS25](https://github.com/MariusFurter/MAT740-Topology-in-Lean-HS25)

This material was adapted from https://github.com/miguelmarco/topologia_general_lean.

Course Contents:

1. Introduction to Lean
   - Coding in Lean ([Basics.lean](./MAT740TopologyInLeanHS25/Background/Basics.lean.lean))
   - Overview of tactics ([Tactics.lean](./MAT740TopologyInLeanHS25/Background/Tactics.lean.lean), [Tactics.pdf](./MAT740TopologyInLeanHS25/Background/Tactics.pdf.pdf))
2. Sets and functions
3. [TopologicalSpaces.lean](./MAT740TopologyInLeanHS25/Definitions/TopologicalSpaces.lean) and [ContinuousFunctions.lean](./MAT740TopologyInLeanHS25/Definitions/ContinuousFunctions.lean).
4. ...

Exercises are available in the [Exercises](./MAT740TopologyInLeanHS25/Exercises/) folder.
