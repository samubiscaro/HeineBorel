# Heine Borel theorem in Lean

**Welcome to Topology in Lean!**

In this project, we will formalize the Heine Borel theorem for metric spaces. We will allow ourselves to use everything in [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) apart from `Mathlib.Topology`. We start from the repository of the course [MAT740 TopologyInLean HS25](https://github.com/MariusFurter/MAT740-Topology-in-Lean-HS25).
