# Heine Borel theorem in Lean

In this project, we will formalize the Heine Borel theorem for metric spaces. We will allow ourselves to use everything in [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) apart from `Mathlib.Topology`. We start from the repository of the course [MAT740 TopologyInLean HS25](https://github.com/MariusFurter/MAT740-Topology-in-Lean-HS25).

== Repository outline

The `Project` folder contains the three files formalizing the proof: ```CompleteSpaces.lean```, ```BoundedSpaces.lean``` and ``HeineBorel.lean``. Note that these three files all depend on basically all of the files in the course repository ``` MAT740-Topology-in-Lean-HS25```.
